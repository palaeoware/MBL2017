## 2. Installation

MBL2017 requires the [Qt library](https://www.qt.io). It has been tested with Qt versions 5.3, 5.5, and 5.10 but should be compatible with all Qt versions greater than 5.3. It has been tested on Windows and Ubuntu Linux, but will in theory work on any Qt-capable system. To compile and run,  (a) install Qt, (b) open the .pro file MBL2017.pro in Qt Creator, and (c) specify build kit. MBL2017 includes random numbers, but if these fail you will get a warning and should then place a randomnumbers.dat file in the build directory. This should contain a sequence of random bytes, and should be at least 65536 bytes in length. Suitable data can be downloaded from https://qrng.anu.edu.au/

MBL2017 uses [QCustomPlot](http://www.qcustomplot.com/) v 1.3.1 for visualisation - source code included in this package, see comments for license.

MBL2017 uses a GUI theme designed by Alan R.T. Spencer, and implemented by Russell J. Garwood.

## 3. Usage

Descriptions of the algorithms used in this package are included in the references above. 

### Version 1

To initiate an MBL run, change parameters in GUI then use Start from the file menu. A simulation can be stopped prematurely using Stop. Use 'Chart to PDF' from the file menu to generate a PDF version of the onscreen chart.

#### Main parameters (always visible in main window)

Extinction probability: the probability of a lineage going extinct in a time increment (0=never, 1=always)

Speciation probability: the probability of a lineage speciating in a time increment (0=never, 1=always). NOTE - the program does not check that these sum to 1 or less.

FDT cut-off: How many increments old the most recent common ancestor of two species has to be for them to be considered to be different genera under the FDT algorithm

Time increments per tree - how many increments will each tree be run for.

Maximum leaf-count - when a tree reaches this number of leaves the tree-simulation will stop for that tree. If the program is in 'throw away trees hitting leaf limit' mode (Mode menu - recommended) these trees will be discarded. Otherwise they will be included in taxonomy with the 'present' considered to be the timestep in which they halted. To avoid any such behavior, set this to a very large value (100000 or more). Note that trees hitting the limit are reported in the log window even if the program is not in 'output results per tree' mode

Trees to run - how many separate MBL trees to simulate

Filename stub - if tree files are output (see below), the program prepends any text in this box to their name

#### Tree Export Menu

Tick any of the three export items to have MBL2017 generate a tree file with the selected taxonomy for each tree it successfully generates. The tree format is selected in this menu as well. More than one tree type can be exported at once, but only a single format can be selected. Tree export will only take place if an output folder has been chosen with the final item on this menu

#### Mode menu

Contains checkable menu-items to control the behaviour of the program.

Include RTDT/FDT results table - if checked these items generate tables of genus-count frequencies suitable for export (as csv files) via copy/paste to other software

Log scale - if checked the x (genus size) scale of the graph is logarithmic

Throw away trees hitting leaf limit - see maximum leaf count above

Continue until correct number of trees. In this mode, the program will continue generating trees until it has successfully generated the required number, rather than simply trying the specified number of generation runs. Trees that have 0 extant leaves at the end of the number of increments specified OR that hit the leaf limit will hence be re-tried. Be aware that with poorly chosen parameters, a simulation set up in this way may never finish, though it can always be halted with 'stop' from the file menu.

Output results per tree - if this is checked the program operates in verbose mode, logging the size of each tree found (and more besides).

### Version 2

Version 2 adds a binary character evolution model, and some custom output functions to produce batch TNT and Mr Bayes files for a particular phylogeny testing exercise. New GUI elements are:

New Tree Export Format: TNT/MrBayes. This generates trees (in NEXUS format) together with batch files for TNT and Mr Bayes.
Settings: Precise leaf count. Set to 0 for 'normal' functionality. If not 0, a clade within each tree is selected that is of exactly this size. If one is not found, the tree is discarded.
Mutate chance. The chance of each binary character 'flipping' each time step. By default this is 0.02.
